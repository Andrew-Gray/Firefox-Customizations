# Firefox-Customizations

Note: This is all working as of 133.0.3. Any version before or after is not guaranteed to work correctly. 

Settings (user.js) based on [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox)

# Setup
1. Download the source code zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Andrew-Gray/Firefox-Customizations/releases)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a place you can easily access (we will get back to it later)
3. In Firefox, type `about:support` into the address bar
4. In the about:support page, find `Profile Folder`, click on `Open Folder`
5. Copy and paste the `user.js` file from the extracted zip into the opened folder
6. Copy and paste the `chrome` folder from the extracted zip folder into the opened folder
7. Back in Firefox, click the `Clear startup cache` button, then click Restart
